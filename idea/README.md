# Dreamers
  The aim of the project is to develop a web-based application for geographical monitoring & strengthening of Healthcare Programs.
Health influences the overall characteristics of a nation in every dimension, from education to productivity, impacting the overall economic output. 
Governments put an enormous effort and substantial resources to ensure good health and wellbeing of its citizens.
The effectiveness of such efforts mainly depends upon the identification of the beneficiaries who are in an actual need for attention towards their health and nourishment.​
Artificial Intelligence and Geographic Information System will help towards “Geographical monitoring & strengthening of Healthcare”

Our Solution : 
We come up with an application incorporating Machine Learning and geographical monitoring & strengthening of Healthcare Programs. There are multiple features covering various aspects. 
* Malnutrition detection (Undernutrition, overnutrition, and obesity) with height, weight, and age :
  * Our solution can detect whether a person is suffering from undernutrition or is overweight, or is obese based on their height, weight, and age of the person. 
  * The Government can then utilize this data to visualize the overall picture at state and subdivision levels and prioritize delivery of their schemes to the correct population.

  
* Disease prediction based on symptoms :
  * Most of the common diseases like diabetes, hypertension, malaria, typhoid, jaundice, tuberculosis, etc. require laboratory diagnosis. 
  *  Our application features an algorithm to detect some of these diseases based on the symptoms associated to them using advanced machine learning techniques.
    Helps in early detection and treatment of diseases.

* Predicting groundwater level : 
  * Population growth and urban expansion have dramatically increased the demand of clean drinking water, leading to over exploitation of 
    This emphasizes the importance of predicting future groundwater level for a sustainable future.
  *  We plan to use a regression-based approach to predict the groundwater levels in the upcoming years based on sequences of monthly groundwater maps.
